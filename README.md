This website acts as a supplementary tool to aid in study planning. It is common for students to see projects and exams as percentages but not really know how to intrinsically plan for their studies. This website converts the weightages of the assignments and exams to time-based divisions, making it easy for you to plan your studies and get good grades. :)
